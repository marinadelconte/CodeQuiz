# CodeQuiz

## Description

This application utilizes JavaScript, HTML and CSS to display a multiple quiz choice on some JavaScript fundamentals. Upon clicking start, the user will see a timer begin to countdown from 90 seconds and the questions will begin rendering on the screen. If the user submits the incorrect answer the timer will subtract 10 seconds. The quiz will end when the timer gets to 0 seconds or the user answers all of the questions. At the end it will prompt the user to enter their initials to save their high score.
